![Img4](InstanaImgs/Img4.jpg)

**Note:** Instana will offer SAP Cloud Foundry observability in a future release. Kyma Kubernetes Cluster monitoring already works with the current Instana version. 

# Overview of IBM Instana and its capabilities in SAP BTP environment 

IBM Instana provides real-time monitoring and observability for SAP BTP applications. Its key capabilities include: 
- **Full-Stack Observability**: Monitors the entire SAP BTP stack, including application performance, microservices, databases, and containers. 
- **Auto-Discovery and Dependency Mapping**: Automatically discovers and maps services and their interdependencies. 
- **Real-Time Performance Monitoring**: Monitors key metrics in real time to detect anomalies and optimize performance. 
- **AI-Powered Insights and Root Cause Analysis**: Uses AI to provide intelligent insights and identify root causes of performance issues. 
- **Integration and Extensibility**: Integrates with other monitoring tools and supports a wide range of technologies. 
- **Automation and Remediation**: Offers smart alerts, automatic event correlation, and proactive issue resolution.  

# Exploring the concept of SAP BTP cloud-native applications with Instana 

SAP BTP cloud-native applications, built using cloud-native principles like microservices architecture and DevOps practices, incorporate Java Spring Boot frameworks and utilize HTTP clients for seamless integration with external services. These applications leverage cloud services, container orchestration, and prioritize scalability and resilience. See the below diagram for the reference

![Img5](InstanaImgs/Img5.jpg)

The Instana Agent is installed within the SAP BTP account, enabling monitoring of various applications such as node.js, Python, Java Spring Boot, and even the S/4 HANA Cloud Database. Instana effectively monitors these microservices applications, providing visibility into their output and facilitating monitoring through the Instana Dashboard. 

# SAP BTP Kyma

SAP BTP's Kyma runtime is a managed Kubernetes runtime that utilizes the open-source project "Kyma." It allows developers to enhance SAP products by incorporating serverless Functions and seamlessly integrating them with containerized microservices. This cloud-native approach offers several benefits, including improved flexibility, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. Kyma's modular design enables users to select and customize modules based on their specific business needs. Modules can be enabled or disabled as required, giving users control over the infrastructure expenses associated with their chosen modules.

![Img6](InstanaImgs/Img6.jpg)

[Kyma](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-business-technology-platform/kyma-environment) and Docker simplify application deployment. JAR/TAR file is generated after the compilation of the SAP BTP Cloud application. This file is then used to create a Docker image using a Dockerfile. The compiled version of the application is included in the Docker image, which is then pushed to a Kubernetes cluster. Consequently, the BTP application is deployed and operational within the cluster.

**Challenges and risks associated with lack of real-time monitoring and the need:**
Real-time monitoring in SAP BTP lets customers harness the power of proactive detection and transform their operations, eliminating problems related to sluggish performance, downtime, and troubleshooting frustrating errors. Real-time monitoring provides for a much improved user experience, supporting swift action against performance degradation and prompt resolution of issues. Downtime is significantly reduced, and incidents resolved before they even have a chance to grow.
In addition, real-time monitoring adds extra compliance and security, reducing risks  and safeguarding your operations. Resource allocation can now be well orchestrated by optimizing efficiency and eliminating waste.

# Current offerings by SAP BTP vs offerings by IBM Instana

**CPU Utilization:**

Instana enables real-time CPU utilisation monitoring, allowing you to track and optimise the use of processing resources in your application. You can ensure optimal resource allocation and discover any irregularities or spikes that may impair performance by analysing CPU utilisation.

![Img9](InstanaImgs/Img9.jpg)

**Memory Utilization:**

By giving you access into memory usage, Instana enables you to keep an eye on how much memory your application is using. You may find memory leaks, improve memory allocation, and avoid out-of-memory issues, which can have an impact on your application's stability and speed, by monitoring memory utilisation.

![Img10](InstanaImgs/Img10.jpg)

**SQL Traces:**

SQL tracing is not natively supported by SAP BTP Kyma. It necessitates the use of third-party performance monitoring tools, databases with built-in SQL tracing capabilities, log4j logging frameworks, and so on. However, IBM Instana has solved the bottleneck.

![Img11](InstanaImgs/Img11.jpg)

Instana offers SQL traces, which capture and analyze the database queries executed by your application. By examining SQL traces, you can identify slow queries, optimize database interactions, and enhance overall database performance.

We recommend you follow the IBM Instana Documentation to install the Instana Agent to the SAP BTP Kyma Cluster. [Click here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/247?topic=openshift-instana-kubectl-plug-in) for the official documentation.
